\chapter{Evaluation}

After laying down the theoretical analysis of the scan algorithms and providing
an efficient implementation it is time to verify whether the expectations hold
up in reality. This chapter does so with a focus on six basic questions.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Can the early pruning in \bwv{} beat the performance of \simdscan{}
despite of branching overhead?
  \item How large is this branching overhead?
  \item Is the early pruning probability difference of \bwv{} and \bs{} visible in practice?
  \item What is the impact of predicate selectivity on early pruning?
  \item How much time does it take to bring data in the formats required by the scanning algorithms.
  \item Are there visible improvements due to the bandwidth reduction of block-wise scanning?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Benchmark Setup}

All benchmarks were performed on a dual-CPU Intel Xeon E5-2697 v3 machine. This
Haswell setup had 56 physical and logical cores but all benchmarks only measure
single-core performance. Memory was supplied by eight banks with eight
gigabytes of DDR4 RAM each, running at 1067\,MHz. On the software side Ubuntu
14.04 was used and GCC 4.8 compiled the benchmark code, except for \simdscan{}
which was using a binary compiled with ICC.
